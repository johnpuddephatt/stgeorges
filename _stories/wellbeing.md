intro: |
  In coming I’m part of a group and it’s also become a bit of a social thing.

  We do the exercise and then we have a coffee afterwards and what started off as a half an hour exercise class can often lead up to one and a half, two hours at St George’s.

Ian started coming along to the chair exercise classes at St George’s after experiencing a few problems resulting from a health condition.

He finds the pelvic floor and posture exercises that are part of the class have led to a significant improvement for him.

Ian is like many of our community members in that he’s seen a big social benefit to coming to St George’s, even though that wasn’t what brought him here.
