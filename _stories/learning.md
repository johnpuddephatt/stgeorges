  Because I came on a course here that helped me look after my mum, I felt a duty to offer something back.

  I wanted to help others in the community, so I’ve used my experience of caring to help carers here. It’s very one on one; it’s all about understanding their journey.

Juli completed a 24-week course on the principles of dementia to help her understand how to care for and look after her mum, who has vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s.

She’s been volunteering with us for just over a year and brings a valuable combination of understanding and compassion to the role.
