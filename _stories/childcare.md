  We moved from London to Wakefield due to work and needed to find a new nursery for our son. We feel so lucky to have him at St George’s.

  We really appreciate all the effort put in to help him settle and be happy, it has made things much easier for us.

When we asked parents what they thought of us, one thing came through really clearly – they love dropping their children off somewhere they know makes them happy. We think that’s important too, because happy children means more time spent learning and developing.
