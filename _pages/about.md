  content: "We know the work St George’s does makes a real difference to our community
    members. But we also know that the way we do things matters just as much as what
    we actually do. That’s why everything we do is guided by our values. They tell
    our community members what they can expect from us, and help our staff make the
    right decisions.\n\n### We’re welcoming\nSt George’s exists to meet the needs
    of a diverse local community. That means providing friendly, inclusive spaces
    where everyone feels welcome.\n\n### We’re positive\nWe want to raise aspirations
    and give people the opportunity to make life-improving choices. That means we
    look to inspire people with a positive, can-do attitude.\n\n### We’re caring\nBeing
    caring means we treat people with respect, compassion and dignity. But it also
    means that we work with passion, because we care about making a difference.\n\n###
    We’re fair\nWe’re here for everyone in Lupset, which means we believe in treating
    people equally and without prejudice.\n\n### We’re responsible\nWe take pride
    in being honest and professional in all that we do. That means taking responsibility,
    not only for how we treat the people we work with, but also how we look after
    our money.\n\n### Our Safeguarding Statement\n• St George’s Lupset Ltd (St George’s)
    is committed to and takes its duty of safeguarding and promoting the well-being
    of all children, young people and vulnerable adults and protecting them from harm,
    seriously. \n\n• St George’s recognises that children, young people and some adults
    can be vulnerable and rely on the support of adults and the wider community to
    help them reach their full potential. \n\n• St George’s respects everyone irrespective
    of gender, sexuality, race, culture, religion or economic status and that they
    have the right to play as full a part as possible within their community. \n\n•
    This commitment is shared by trustees, staff, students and volunteers working
    at or with St George’s.\n"

- title: Our purpose
  content: |+
    We’re a locally-focused independent charity and recognised community anchor working with the public and private sector for positive change in Lupset, West Wakefield and beyond. Founded in 1997, we’ve successfully delivered services and activities to improve personal and community health and wellbeing for the past 20 years.

    ### We’re here to meet the needs of our community
    The things we do are created by and for local people. Our services and activities are designed to meet the diverse needs of young people, families and older people.

    ### We’re here to make the local area better
    We play an important part in regenerating the neighbourhood, creating local employment and generating investment that’s retained locally – over £14M over the past 20 years.

    ### We’re here to provide a friendly, trusted space
    We are a welcoming space for the community with meeting rooms, IT facilities, a coffee shop, community allotment and four childcare settings across Wakefield – Lupset, Eastmoor and Sandal. It matters to us that we provide an environment free from exploitation and fear.

    ### We’re here to have long term impact
    We’re a strong, resilient organisation with 53 different partner organisations and an income of £1.2M of which over 88% comes from non-grant sources.
